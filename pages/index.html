        <p>Consider situations in which you find your wishes differing from those of another person. How do
            you usually respond to such situations?</p>
        <p>On the following pages are several pairs of statements describing possible behavioral responses.</p>
        <p>In many cases, neither statement may be very typical of your behavior, but
            please select the response which you would be more likely to use.</p>
